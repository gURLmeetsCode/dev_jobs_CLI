Personal Objectives:

* Display a list of current job openings from Stackoverflow website
* Filtered results for entry levels positions in the Bay Area.

Project Objectives:

* When user installs GEM, I wanted he/she to be able to go search through the data by typing the associated number to the listed job post.
* User should have visibility on the job title, company and location.


Notes
* currently I am not receiving a numbered list.
* when you type a number it is giving all the data instead of the specified input
